# GDH-3DViewer
A one-click 3D viewer for designs on Geodesign Hub, using [OSM Buildings](https://osmbuildings.org/) library. This plugin takes design data from the [Geodesign Hub API](https://www.geodesignhub.com/api) and transforms the polygons drawn to random buildings and road generation. In addition, the generated footprint data can be downloaded as GeoJSON.

You can add it to your Geodesign Hub project.
